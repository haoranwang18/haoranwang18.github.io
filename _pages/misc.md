# Others

In my free time, I enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures such as backcountry skiing, hiking, and gravel biking. I also have a passion for photography and videography, which I use to document these experiences. While I primarily track my activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24770040), my most epic adventures occasionally make their way to my blog and YouTube channel.
